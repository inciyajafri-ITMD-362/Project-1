    <h4> What is domestic violence?</h4>
    <p class="description"> Domestic violence is violent or aggressive behavior within the home, typically involving the violent abuse of a spouse or partner.</p>
    <h4> What can you do?</p>
    <p class="description"> Donating does not always just have to be about money. There are many shelters where you can donate anything such as clothes and food as well.
      We need to remember the fact that these victims arenâ€™t always lucky and find their way out. Another way to help is to volunteer time to help with
      food drives and other fundraising opportunites.</p>
